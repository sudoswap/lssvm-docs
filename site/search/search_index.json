LPs will call either createPairETH or createPairERC20 depending on their token type (i.e. if they wish to utilize ETH or an ERC20). This will deploy a new LSSVMPair contract. Each pair has one owner (initially set to be the caller), and multiple pools for the same token and NFT pair can exist, even for the same owner. This is due to each pair having its own potentially different spot price and bonding curve. Pair Types Each pair can be one of 3 types: Token, NFT, or Trade. A Token pair holds either ETH or an ERC20 token and will give a quote for how much it will pay for any NFT in the collection it has been created for. An NFT pair holds NFTs and will give a quote for how much it will sell for any NFT it has in its inventory. A Trade pair holds both NFTs and tokens, and it will give a quote for both buying and selling, with a spread between the quotes as the LP fee. Pair Parameters During the creation call, LPs supply the following parameters: IERC721 _nft, // The ERC721 token side of the pair ICurve _bondingCurve, // The bonding curve used to price the pair address payable _assetRecipient, // If set to a non-zero address, assets sent to the pair during a swap will be forwarded to this address.

At present, there are two choices: LinearCurve and ExponentialCurve . Both curves are parameterized by one variable, delta , which is set in the pair itself. More bonding curve contracts can be whitelisted in the future for use with LSSVMPairFactory . After a user trades with a pair, the pair consults its bonding curve to determine what its new price should be. Technical note: the bonding curves are intended to be pure, i.e. they do not modify the state of pairs that call them. The actual logic for input/output validation and price updating happens in the LSSVMPair contract itself. Linear Curve The linear curve performs an additive operation to update the price. delta is assumed to be set properly by the LP to be the same precision of the pair's underlying token. If the pair has just sold an NFT by giving out an NFT and receiving tokens, the next price it will quote to sell NFTs at will be delta more. Conversely, if the pair has just bought an NFT by giving out tokens and receiving an NFT, the next price it will quote to purchase NFTs at will be delta less. Exponential Curve The exponential curve performs a multiplicative operation. delta is treated as a multiplier assuming a fixed point system where 1e18 is 1. For example, if delta is 1e18 + 1e17 , this represents a 10% change in price each time. If the pair has just sold an NFT by giving out an NFT and receiving tokens, the next price it will quote to sell NFTs at will be multiplicatively delta more. Conversely, if the pair has just bought an NFT by giving out tokens and receiving an NFT, the next price it will quote to purchase NFTs at will be multiplicatively delta less. Understanding Spot Price In addition to modifying delta to change the pair's price reactivity, it is important to understand how the spotPrice variable in LSSVMPair behaves. The spot price refers to the instantaneous price of selling 1 NFT to the pair. The instantaneous price of buying 1 NFT from the pair is set to be the spotPrice adjusted upwards by 1 unit of delta with respect to the pair's bonding curve. For example, say that we have a Trade LSSVMPair for ETH with a spotPrice of 1 ETH, and a linear curve with a delta of 0.1 ETH. (Assume fee is 0.) Then a user selling 1 NFT to the pair would receive 1 ETH, whereas a user purchasing 1 NFT from the pair would have to send (1 + 0.1) = 1.1 ETH. In other words, the price to purchase an NFT from a pair will always be delta greater (either additively on multiplicatively) than the price to sell an NFT to the pair. Pair managers who are manually adjusting spotPrice should keep this in mind. (Note that for simplicity, some examples in this documentation may use \"spot price\" to also refer to the instantaneous buy price.) Pricing For Multi-Swaps If a user buys or sells multiple NFTs in one swap transaction, the spotPrice will update by delta for each NFT bought or sold. For example, say that we have a Trade LSSVMPair for ETH with a spotPrice of 1 ETH, and a linear curve with a delta of 0.1 ETH. (Assume fee is 0.) If a user sells 5 NFTs to this pair, they will receive: 1 ETH for the first NFT 0.9 ETH for the second NFT 0.8 ETH for the third NFT 0.7 ETH for the fourth NFT 0.6 ETH for the fifth NFT At the end of the multi-swap, the new spotPrice will be set to 0.5 ETH.","title":"Bonding Curves and Pricing"},{"location":"pricing/#bonding-curves-and-pricing","text":"To determine pricing, each LSSVMPair is associated with a specific bonding curve set by the LP.

Users can set allowances for tokens and NFTs once for the router, instead of for each new pool they wish to swap with. On the protocol level, the sudoswap AMM does not perform any routing optimization on-chain. Users are expected to know their desired swap paths when calling the router, e.g. via the use of an off-chain indexing service. NFT<>Token Swaps When swapping tokens for NFTs, users can either specify which NFT IDs they want from each pair, or they can ask for any ID from the pair. When swapping from NFT to tokens or from tokens to NFTs, the LSSVMRouter has two types of swaps: a Normal Swap and a Robust Swap. Normal Swap A Normal Swap is conceptually similar to token-to-token swaps on other DEXs. The user sends the router a maximum input amount or minimum output amount (i.e. allowed slippage), as well as a swap route and a deadline. The router will then swap across the various pairs specified. At the end of all the swaps, the router will total all tokens to be received or sent, and revert if the total is beyond the user's specified slippage. Robust Swap In contrast, a Robust Swap does a slippage check per swap pair rather than an aggregate check at the end. If the price for a specified swap pair is past the allowable slippage, the router will silently skip that route and move on to the next one, with no reverts or errors. This is intended for situations where the price can move quickly between your transaction submission and execution. Normal vs Robust Swap To see the difference between these swap types, consider this example: say there are 2 pairs for NFT and ETH. The first pair has a spot price of 1 ETH and a linear curve with a delta of 0.1 ETH. The second pair has a spot price of 1 ETH and a linear curve with a delta of 1 ETH. A user wishes to purchase NFTs, one from each pool for 1 ETH each, with 10% slippage. The user submits a swap transaction. Before this transaction is executed, someone else goes and buys 1 NFT from each pool for 1 ETH each. The new spot price for the first pair is 1.1 ETH, and for the second pair is 2 ETH. If the user had submitted a Normal Swap, they would have sent 2.2 ETH (2 ETH + 0.2 ETH to cover the additional 10% slippage), and the transaction would fail, as they would have sent enough ETH to cover the first swap at the new price of 1.1 ETH, but not enough to cover the second swap at 2 ETH. In contrast, if the user had submitted a Robust Swap, they would have also sent 2.2 ETH, but with a per-swap max cost of 1.1 ETH. The router would have enough to cover the first swap at 1.1 ETH. Then, upon seeing the second swap would cost 2 ETH, the router would skip this pair entirely. The transaction would succeed, refunding 1.1 ETH back to the user, as well as sending them the one NFT they purchased for 1.1 ETH. Thus, the Robust Swap is generally recommended for a better user experience in higher volatility environments, at the cost of slightly more gas.
