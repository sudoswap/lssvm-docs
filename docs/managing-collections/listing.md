# Listing on Sudoswap

Compatible ERC721 NFTs can be deposited and traded on sudoswap immediately after they are minted, without the need for collections to be manually listed.

For a collection to show up in the search bar, it must have at least one liquidity pool or past volume on sudoswap. However, even if a collection does not show up, holders can still [create liquidity pools](https://docs.sudoswap.xyz/user-guide/creating-a-pool.md) for it as normal.

## Launching on Sudoswap

There is no special procedure to launch an NFT collection on sudoswap. However, if you'd like to make sudoswap part of your launch, you can:
1. Deploy an NFT smart contract as you would for any other collection.
2. Mint part or all of the supply to an address you control.
3. [Create a liquidity pool](https://docs.sudoswap.xyz/user-guide/creating-a-pool.md) on sudoswap with those NFTs.
4. Tell collectors to buy from the liquidity pool.

When launching a collection like this, it is advised to deposit no more than a few hundred NFTs in each liquidity pool. Depositing too many NFTs in a single pool may cause poor performance for collectors trading through the sudoswap website.
