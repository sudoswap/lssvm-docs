# ERC1155 Support

sudoAMM v2 adds support for ERC1155 NFT pairs against both ETH and ERC20 tokens. The design of ERC1155 pairs is similar to that of ERC721 pairs, with the key difference being that ERC1155 pairs must specify a single NFT ID that can be traded by the pair.

The NFT ID permitted to trade must be provided when the pair is created, after which it cannot be changed.

## Factory and Router Support

ERC1155 pairs are created with dedicated methods on the `LSSVMPairFactory`: `createPairERC1155ETH` and `createPairERC1155ERC20`.

There are no dedicated methods for ERC1155 pairs on the routers as they are fully compatible with the generic methods.
