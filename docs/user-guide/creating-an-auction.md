# Creating an Auction

Auctions are a type of sudoswap pool that use the [gradual Dutch auction](../reference/pricing.md#gda-curve) (GDA) or related bonding curves. Anyone can create an auction to buy or sell NFTs on sudoswap.

To create an auction, navigate to the [Create Auction](https://sudoswap.xyz/#/auction/create) interface. Then, follow the steps below.

1. On the [Create Auction](https://sudoswap.xyz/#/auction/create) interface, select an NFT collection in the top pane: ![](https://i.imgur.com/n7rePKc.jpg)

3. Optionally, choose an ERC20 token the NFTs should trade against. By default, NFTs trade against ETH.
